## Project Information
This repository contains my implementation of the traffic sign recognition classifier for the Udacity CarND Nanodegree (original Udacity project repo can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project)). 

* [`Traffic_Sign_Classifier_Report.ipynb`](https://github.com/mchano/CarND-P02-Traffic-Sign-Classifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier_Report.ipynb) contains the Udacity starter code and my implementation of the traffic sign recognition classifier using a convolutional neural network trained using TensorFlow. 
* [`Report.pdf`](https://github.com/mchano/CarND-P02-Traffic-Sign-Classifier/blob/master/Report.pdf) contains a write up on the dataset, the model architecture and its training process, the resulting model and its accuracy in predicting new roadsigns.
